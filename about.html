            <p>
                An About Us page can be one of the most important pages on your
                website but it is one of the most overlooked elements on your
                website normally. About Us pages can highlight why you created
                your business, your commitment to sustainability, or you can
                tell the story of how your business came to be. As an important
                part of your website your About Us page can set you apart from
                your competitors in a way that can build your brand in a positive way.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="col-2">
            <h3>1:Vision and Mission</h3>

            <p>Start your About Us page by telling your customers about yourself. What is unique about you,
                what are your key features and what is your mission? Try to stand out by conveying your values
                and culture as a brand, or what brought your company together. Use this area to fully answer
                the question of who you are as a brand, and what you represent.
                This doesnâ€™t mean that it has to be overly lengthy, but you can use this space to communicate
                yourself in the way you are comfortable with, with your audience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-2">
            <h3>2:Your History</h3>
            <p>Take the visitors on your website to a trip down memory lane, and give
                them an insight to the history behind your store. Here, you can show
                them where, how, and when you started, and everything your business
                has accomplished on the way. This is your chance to share your relevant
                milestones and achievements relating to your business in an engaging way.
                You can even choose to present your history to your viewers in the form of a timeline,
                which allows you to display a large amount of information in a visually engaging manner.
                Your customers or potential customers might be interested in seeing how you grew over the years.</p>

        <div class="col-2">
            <h3>3:Team Member Profiles</h3>
            <p>
                Add an emotional element to your About Us page by adding details of the people
                that are driving the passion at your business. People find it easier to connect
                with human beings, so allow the personality of your crew to shine through the About Us page.
            </p>

        <div class="col-2">
            <h3>4:Multimedia & Infographics</h3>
            <p>
                A well-built infographic might help visitors remember
                about you or your business better than any amount of words.
                So if you think it works better for your brand or business,
                skip the lengthy description, or add a well-designed graphic
                that can help your visitors understand your concept. Or maybe
                you would like to add a cool video about how your business was created,
                or about your story and let it speak for itself.
